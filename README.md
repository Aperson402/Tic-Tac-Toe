# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Python code defines the logic for a Tic Tac Toe game, implementing various functions to manage the game state, player actions, and determine the winner. It begins with initializing the board and determining the player to make the next move. The actions function identifies all possible moves on the board, while the result function updates the board state based on a player's move. The winner function checks for winning conditions horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The terminal function determines if the game has ended, and the utility function assigns scores to different game outcomes. The minimax algorithm is then implemented to determine the optimal move for each player. Overall, this concise and well-structured code provides a foundation for a functional Tic Tac Toe game.
